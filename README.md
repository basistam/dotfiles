# Dotfiles

This is my setup of dotfiles.
Feel free to use any of them at any time.

My dotfiles are designed to run under Mac OSX 10.10.

## Installation
In order to get everything up & running you need to:

- Install homebrew

- Install tmux (reattach-to-user-namespace also required)

- Install Powerline fonts
